#### Loss Functions for Multilabel Classification:
**Focal Loss**: Focal loss is used to address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-classify examples.
**Class Balanced Focal Loss**: Variation of focal loss adjusts for class imbalance by weighting the loss based on the frequency of each class.
**Distribution Balanced Loss**: Used to better handle the overlapping nature of multiple labels, by modeling the label distributions rather than treating labels as independent.
